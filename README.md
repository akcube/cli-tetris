# cli-tetris
A fun command line implementation of tetris.

The code for this was initially written in Turbo C++ for my high school capstone project and sadly, using Turbo C++ was a requirement. The program in itself is pretty decent and took hours of effort, so I will be attempting to port it from its DOS roots to a modern-er command line game. 

Here's a list of improvements I plan on making,

- The major change is to remove any and all dependencies on conio.h to something like ncurses
- Fix some bugs related to taking long inputs
- Make the timings feel smoother and attempt to make the blocks look more 'square-er'
- Split the program into multiple files

Feel free to share any suggestions / ideas you may have!
